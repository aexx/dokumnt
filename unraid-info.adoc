=== Booting USB drive inside Unraid VM

Source: https://forums.unraid.net/topic/82092-solved-create-vm-from-bootable-live-usb-drive/

- Plug in the USB Drive
- Mount it (I think I mounted it for this......if that doesn't work, try NOT mounting it)
- Go to create your VM template. Set whatever you want for CPUs, Memory, etc.....
- For BIOs....try both (I had to use SeaBIOS)
- For USB Controller, I used the 3.0 one so I would get the faster speed
- In terminal, run +
    `ls -lha /dev/disk/by-id/`
- Find your USB Drive in that list and copy the ENTIRE name. Use that name for your Manual vDisk Location. +
  For example, I put this in my VM template. It must be the entire USB drive...no part stuff +
    `/dev/disk/by-id/usb-SanDisk_Extreme_SSD_31393.....3934-0:0`
- Primary vDisk Type: raw
- Primary vDisk Bus: USB
- Graphics Card: VNC
